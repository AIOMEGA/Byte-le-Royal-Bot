--------Strategy---------
Bot starts by moving out of the starting location as far as it can.
Then the bot scans surrounding tiles if possible
The Bot should determine what team it is on and prioritize ore based on its team
With its team in mind it should count up the scores of the surrounding ores
Which ever ore patch within its vision is worth more it will become the bots target
The bot should also keep track of its inventory and how many turns it is away from base
If the turnsAway + turnsLeft = 200 then it should return to base
